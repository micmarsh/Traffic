To Run:
Make sure Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) is installed open this directory as an existing project in Eclipse (File: new: Java Project). Before running go to Run: Run Configurations, then to the "arguments" tab to ensure "sample.in" (w/o quotes) is listed as the program's first argument.

Buttons: 

-Step: Moves each car forward by it's velocity
-Play/Pause: Constantly "presses" step at the desired frames per second
-Rewind: Moves cars backwards one step, or undoes the most recent jump
-Reset: Resets all cars to their original starting position

Tips/Warnings:

-To make a car jump, click on the "body"(not the wheels), then click on the location you want it to jump to (you can click outside of the road, the car will jump to that X coordinate).

-To adjust frame per second, pause the program *by pressing pause*, enter the new fps, then hit play

-FPS can't be negative

-Clicking on a car in motion ("Play"), pauses the program. If you resume the program the car will stand still until you click again
