To Run:
Make sure Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) is installed open this directory as an existing project in Eclipse (File: new: Java Project).
Buttons: 

-Step: Moves each car forward by it's velocity
-Play/Pause: Constantly "presses" step at the desired frames per second
-Rewind: Moves cars backwards one step, or undoes the most recent jump
-Reset: Resets all cars to their original starting position

Editing:

-You can edit a car at any time by clicking on the car and selecting "adjust car" in the menubar

-"Undo" is the same as "Rewind".


Tips/Warnings:

-Be very careful when editing and pressing "Reset": you'll undo any changes, new cars, and new roads (this will be made "safer" soon)

-You don't yet get an alert if you try to quit without saving: it will just quit.

-To adjust frame per second, pause the program *by pressing pause*, enter the new fps, then hit play

-FPS can't be negative

-Clicking on a car in motion ("Play"), pauses the program. If you resume the program the car will stand still until you click again
